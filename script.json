        "EDUCATION":"Maria always had a strong internal drive to succeed and make her own way in the world. She is an Applied Biology fresh graduate from the City University of Hong Kong. \n Before going to university, she studied Associate degree in Science in Hong Kong Community College because her high school public exam score was not satisfactory, yet this academic failure did not beat her up. It even made her stronger and become a proactive learner. \n In university, she also challenged herself to study abroad in the US for one semester and also joined a international synthetic biology competition (iGEM). Her life goal is to become a lifelong learner.  %[Why Biology?!](postback:education_biology) %[Exchange Programme](postback:education_USA) %[iGEM](postback:iGEM)",
